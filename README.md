Code repository of the master thesis:
Kernel-based methods for persistent homologyand their applications to Alzheimer’s Disease

The script persistence_graphs_generator.py provides the tools for building the images of the thesis

The script oasis_svm.py provide various example of svm classification applied to persistence diagrams.
In particular are considered four types of kernel for persistence diagrams, respectively:

Persistence Scale-Space Kernel 
- Reininghaus, J. et al. ‘A stable multi-scale kernel for topological machine learning’. In: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2015, pp. 4741–4748.

Persistence Weighted Gaussian Kernel
- Kusano, G., Hiraoka, Y. and Fukumizu, K. ‘Persistence weighted Gaussian kernel for topological data analysis’. In: International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR. 2016, pp. 2004–2013.

Sliced Wasserstein Kernel
- Carriere, M., Cuturi, M. and Oudot, S. ‘Sliced wasserstein kernel for persistence diagrams’. In: International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR. 2017, pp. 664–673.

Persistence Fisher Kernel
- Le, T. and Yamada, M. ‘Persistence fisher kernel: A riemannian manifold kernel for persistence diagrams’. In: arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.03569
(2018).

Moreover, we test the usage in this context of the so-called Variably Scaled Kernels (VSKs), originally introduced in the field of function approximation.
